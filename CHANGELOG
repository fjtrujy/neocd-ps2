0.6c  - More CDDA fixes
      -	Fixed/added auto-loop feature (CDDA)
      - (re)Fixed missing sfx in aerofighters 2 (and maybe others)
      -	Fixed most Buzzing noise cases
      - drive now stop spinning when CDDA is set to OFF
	
0.6b  - wip holiday release !

0.6a  - Rewrote ps2 sound routines :
	 > Switch to audsrv 0.85 for sound (BIG thanks to Gawd !)
      	 > CDDA support !
      	 > sound upsampling on IOP side
      - Rewrote ps2 video routines.
      - Small performance increase.
      - PAL/NTSC Selector (60hz r0x0rs !)
      - Zip support (limited to the bios, see usage)
      - Fixed the "freezing menu" bug with some exotic pads (SF,NG).
      - Fixed "blocking" state at startup when no CD is present.

0.5   - Triple Buffering using vsync callback 
        (thanks to drakonite for the idea)
      - CD now stop spinning once in the "insert" screen 
        which should help people using swap method.
      - Fixed auto-animation speed (thx mame)
      - Bit better sound emulation, but still not perfect
      - Settings are now saved to MC, and restored at start-up
      - Basic frameskip routine (off by default)
      - Added an error message if bios is not found or invalid.
      - source clean-up 
      
0.4   - Modified CD detection/swap routines, should work better now.
	(Press (X) a second time if cd not detected the first time)
      - Added a workaround for the ps2ip bug (repeated small reads).
        should fix loading with all  version.
      - Corrected ipl.txt parsing routines.
        fix Double Dragon hang up during loading, and probably others.
      - Corrected a bug introduced in last version and preventing from
        loading a game located in "cd" folder when booting from CD.
      - Added the Samurai Spirit RPG patch.
      - Implemented use of "GfxPipe" for gfx rendering.
        Almost all games I've tested are fullspeed without sfx, and still 
        with the old 68k core (who said the ps2 wasn't able to handle it?)
      - Fixed "blinking sprite" gfx bug, no more missing vertical sprites
        in horizontal scrolling games.
      - Added NGCD memory card saves, Neocd will create a 45k file on 
        your memory card if available (memory card in slot 1 only)
      - Corrected support for PSX pads (7not6)
      - In-Game Menu (region selector, sound activation, etc.. see below)
      - added some gfx filter effect and a fullscreen option (to remove
        black border in PAL video mode), see menu description.
      - Correct cpu count cycles (68k core was running at 10Mhz in PAL)
        will be a bit slower but timing will be more accurate
      - Lowered Z80 frequency to 4Mhz (was "overclocked" to 6Mhz)
      - Changed the z80 to a more portable one (fixed sfx in lots of games)
      - Preliminary sound support (buggy and to be optimized)
        use ingame menu to enable/disable it, and consider it just as a 
        preview, since the code is still wip and still need to be work on.
        (thx to lkz with help on fixing THE "freezing" bug with sound)
      - "All-In-One" packed elf with embedded IRX and neocd files (<300kb), 
        only bios still need to be present (for legal reason) in the root 
        directory, see usage for new instructions.
      - Included installation script for the Crystal Chip Boot Manager
                  
0.3   - Compatibily greatly increased (no more sprites/tiles missing).
	thanks so much to Ian for the very very helpull tip !
      - In game "freezing" fixed.
      - Memory save "crash" fixed.
      - Added 2nd controller support & analog controls
      - Added possibility to disable z80 emulation.
      - Optimized rendering code (still not fullspeed for all games).
      - Corrected HDD/MC support ("should" work now, untested).
      - Checks local "cd" folder before asking to swap CD.
      - Rewrote CD reading/swapping code using Hiryu CDVD library.
      	no more iso9660 limitations (max 31 files in root dir, ...)
      	and cd swap issue should be fixed.
      - Removed loading of memcard.bin (useless empty file)
      - Removed need for timer.irx (not used anymore)
      - Automatically set region (EUR for pal ps2, USA for ntsc ps2)

            
0.2a  - Bbug fix on loading/booting code :
      - Fixed controller bug (was not responding after a while).

0.1a  - First release !
